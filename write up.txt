Homework 04

Naming variables in code is all about conveyance. Because there are so few technical requirements to naming variables, naming them is more art than science.
Good variable names are like highlights in a study book. If you highlight too little then no information is conveyed. If you highlight too much then no information can be compartmentalized.
A good variable name should in one to three words convey the information inside it and the purpose it serves toward the larger program.
Commenting is a lot like the process of variable naming except there is much more room for detail in comments. Comments should idealy be a sentence or two for most functions or subroutines
and perhaps a paragraph for a large section of code like a series of classes or operations. Code structure needs to rely on the four pillars
of object oriented programming. You must rely on abstraction to modularize your code and make it usable 20 years down the line. Encapsulation
of things like variables prevents other code from overwriting yours during run-time. Relying on inheritance can tighten up the relationships
between variables and make the code easier to read as a side. Utilizing polymorphism to clean code is a little trickier as it is arguably more for function
and logic. But it still has the ability to let a programmer create dynamic objects which can free memory not only on the computer but also
in the mind of the programmers using the code.
